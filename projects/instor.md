### Goals

 - Goal 1: tool for quering historical flooding events;
 - Goal 2: web-based application to add new flooding and precipitation data;
 - Goal 3: estimate where and when the drainage network requires maintenance;
 - Goal 4: estimate the amount of precipitation for the most commonly flooded areas.

### Milestones

 - Milestone 1: database of flood events and precipitation data. 85%;
 - Milestone 2: generate statistics about the frequent flooded areas;
 - Milestone 3: web-based application to add data to the database and perform queries. 30%;
 - Milestone 4: web-based map to show the flooded areas and the forecasts;
 - Milestone 5: regression method to perform flooding forecast;
 - Milestone 6: add Digital Elevation Map to the database;
 - Milestone 7: add drainage network map to the database;
 - Milestone 8: get real time precipitation data from nearby weather stations.
 - Milestone 9: integration with crowdsourcing GIS such as, for example, Nokia Here or TomTom.
